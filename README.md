## Project Description: 
- This project was created following The Odin Project's curriculum. Specifically, this project was aimed toward becoming more comfortable with HTML and CSS, and learning how to arrange and position content on a webpage using flexbox. Given an image of a webpage template, provided below, my goal was to recreate this webpage from scratch.

## What I've learned:
- Nesting flexbox containers
- Aligning content with justify-content and align-items, specifically for centering.
- Adjusting flex-direction depending on orientation of content.
- Deciding when to use flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.
- Working on styling one section of the page at time, from top to bottom, helped tremendously.
- More experiencing using margin and padding.

## Final Thoughts:
Overall, I really liked the challenge that this project brought and was happy with the result. I knew that learning flexbox for the first time would be a little challenging, but the more I practiced and played around, the more comfortable I became and the more it all came together.
